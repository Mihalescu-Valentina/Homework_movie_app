# Homework_movie_app

This is the final Flutter project created during the course powered by Google Romania as a part of the Digital Workshop for Programmers(spring 2022)
The app allows the user to sign up using an e-mail adress and further on to login using that data. After the user is logged in the app, a list of movies will be shown with their posters,titles ,years of release,genres and ibdm scores. The app provides the user the possibility to have a list of favorite movies, to add a comment to a movie(review) and also to see other reviews as well from different users. Infinite scrolling is possible as well as logging out from the app whenever wanted. There is also a feature that allows filtering the movies.

In terms of the development of the app, Redux architecture was used, Google Firebase was used for the authentification process and a movie api for collecting the data of the movies.
